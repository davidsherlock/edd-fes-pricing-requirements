Force minimum and maximum pricing requirements on FES product submissions.

== Description ==

**FES Pricing Restrictions** for Easy Digital Downloads Frontend Submissions allows you to force minimum and maximum pricing requirements for product submissions. The ability to disallow free product submissions on your marketplace is also included.

##Use-case Examples##

Letâ€™s look at some real-world examples of how FES Pricing Restrictions could potentially be utilised in different scenarios:

* Hosting and distributing vendor files costs money. Set a minimum pricing requirement to help cover marketplace operating expenses.
* Due to hosting costs, you don't want your vendors to upload free (0.00) products to your marketplace. You check the "Disallow Free Submissions" to disable these submissions.

##Features##

* Force minimum and maximum pricing requirements on all product submissions
* Disallow free product submissions if you wish
* Seamless integration with Easy Digital Downloads and Commissions settings
* Translation-ready and contains a POT file to get you started translating into your native language
* Developed using the best practices, with security, extensibility, and readability in mind
